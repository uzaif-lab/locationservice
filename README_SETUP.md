# Child Location Tracker - Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Supabase Database Setup

1. **Go to your Supabase project**: https://app.supabase.com/project/agopuyuxyghgjhvgseyx
2. **Open SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. **Copy and paste the entire content** from `supabase_setup.sql`
4. **Click "Run"** to execute the script

### 2. Android App Configuration

✅ **Already configured with your credentials:**

- Anon Key: Already set in `SupabaseConfig.kt`

### 3. Build and Test

1. **Open project in Android Studio**
2. **Sync project** (should build successfully now)
3. **Install on physical device** (location services need real GPS)
4. **Test database connection** using the "Test" button in the app
5. **Grant all permissions** when prompted
6. **Start location tracking**

## 🔍 Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Database Connection

1. Open the Android app
2. Click "Test" button in the Database Connection card
3. Should show "✅ Connected to Supabase successfully!"

### Test 2: Location Upload

1. Start location tracking in the app
2. Check your Supabase dashboard → Table Editor → locations
3. You should see new location records appearing

### Test 3: Verification Queries

Run these in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM locations;

-- View recent locations
SELECT * FROM locations ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Test the function
SELECT * FROM get_latest_location('child_001');
```

## 📱 App Usage

### First Time Setup

1. **Install** the app on the child's device
2. **Open** the app and grant location permissions
3. **Choose "Allow all the time"** for background location
4. **Test connection** to ensure Supabase is working
5. **Start tracking** - you'll see a persistent notification

### Daily Usage

- The app runs automatically in the background
- Location data is uploaded every 30-60 seconds
- The notification shows tracking is active
- Data is stored securely in your Supabase database

## 🛡️ Security Features

### What's Secure

- ✅ **Row Level Security** prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ **Anonymous users** can only insert/read, not modify
- ✅ **Data validation** prevents invalid coordinates
- ✅ **Using anon key** (not service role) in the app
- ✅ **HTTPS encryption** for all data transmission

### Production Recommendations

- Consider implementing user authentication
- Add rate limiting for API calls
- Set up monitoring and alerts
- Regular database backups
- Enable audit logging

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App won't build

- Make sure you have the latest Android Studio
- Sync the project first
- Check that all dependencies are downloaded

### Location not updating

- Ensure GPS is enabled on the device
- Check that the app has location permissions
- Verify background location is set to "Allow all the time"
- Disable battery optimization for the app

### Database connection fails

- Check your internet connection
- Verify the Supabase URL and anon key
- Ensure the database table was created properly
- Check Supabase project is active

### No data in database

- Check Android app logs for error messages
- Verify location permissions are granted
- Test the database connection in the app
- Ensure the foreground service is running

## 📊 Database Schema

```sql
Table: locations
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- child_id (TEXT, Index)
- latitude (DOUBLE PRECISION, -90 to 90)
- longitude (DOUBLE PRECISION, -180 to 180)
- accuracy (REAL, >= 0)
- speed (REAL, >= 0)
- bearing (REAL)
- timestamp (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ, Index)
```

## 🔑 Important Notes

- **Service Role Key**: Keep this secret! Only use for admin tasks
- **Anon Key**: Used in the app, safe to expose in client code
- **Child ID**: Currently set to "child_001", change for multiple children
- **Data Retention**: Current setup keeps data for 30 days
- **Real-time**: Enabled for live dashboard updates
